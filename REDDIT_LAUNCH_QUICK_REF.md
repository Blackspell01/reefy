## Key Evidence

**Swiftfin tvOS stuck since October 2024 (over a year):**
- https://github.com/jellyfin/Swiftfin/discussions/1294
- No TestFlight available
- No committed timeline
- Last update Jan 12, 2026

**State of the Fin blog (Jan 6, 2026):**
- https://jellyfin.org/posts/state-of-the-fin-2026-01-06/
- Created "tvOS Resync" milestone
- No timeline given

## Target Subs

1. **r/appletv** - Primary, less drama
2. **r/JellyfinCommunity** - Secondary, expect more scrutiny
3. **Skip r/jellyfin** - Read-only

## Response Strategy

**Promo codes:** Be generous. Builds goodwill.

**Criticism:** Accept it. Don't defend. Stick to facts.

**FOSS pushback:** "Source is free. App Store covers fees and commits me to support."

**"Why fork?":** "tvOS stuck since Oct 2024 (over a year). No TestFlight. People needed something now. Long term, tvOS-only makes platform-specific improvements possible to explore."

## Don't Say

- "It's worth it"
